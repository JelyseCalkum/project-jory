The first draft of my profile/portfolio webpage

Portfolio Webpage

Description
This Portfolio Page was built to allow a place for future potential employers to get to know who I am, the projects I've worked/am working on, and how they can contact me. The process of building this webpage gave me a hands-on introduction to starting a project from scratch and taking all I've learned and putting it into practice.
